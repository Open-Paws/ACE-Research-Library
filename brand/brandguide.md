# 2. IDENTITY

### **Mission**

ACE seeks to find and promote the most effective ways to help animals, in pursuit of a world where no individual is denied moral consideration based on irrelevant identity traits such as species.

# 3. AUDIENCE & POSITIONING

### ACE exists within four overlapping communities:
